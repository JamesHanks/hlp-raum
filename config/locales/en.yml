  information_title: "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to talk to the city that you live in?"
  information_text: "The citizens of Utrecht were asked to speak to their city, and were delighted to discover that it wanted to talk back to them. By humanising the built environment in the city of Utrecht, Hallo Lantaarnpaal Utrecht discovered the hidden voices of Utrecht."
